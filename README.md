## Features

### User and Role Management
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can view the total number of users, categorized by their roles (e.g., waiters, managers, inventory managers).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different functionalities are available based on the user's role. Admins have full access, while managers, waiters, and inventory managers have limited access based on their responsibilities.
  
### Inventory Management
- **Item Categorization**: Inventory items can be categorized into club-related categories like beers, wine, gin, water, juice, etc.
- **Bulk Item Addition**: Inventory managers can add multiple items at once, specifying quantities and prices.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Inventory automatically updates when customer orders are placed, preventing overselling.

### Order Tracking and Status Management
- **Waiter Order Logging**: Waiters can log customer orders into the system with specific statuses (unpaid, pending, served, paid) and attach Mpesa payment codes.
- **Manager Monitoring**: Managers can monitor all orders, track order statuses, and know which waiter is responsible for each order.

### Payment Processing
- **Mpesa Integration**: When logging orders, waiters can input Mpesa transaction codes to confirm payments.
- **Order Status**: Orders are updated to reflect payment status (e.g., unpaid, pending, served, paid).

### Reporting and Statistics
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can view detailed statistics about club operations, including user roles, inventory levels, orders processed, and financial data.

---

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Jinja2 for templating)
- **Database**: SQLite (can be configured to use MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Payment Gateway**: Mpesa (or similar) integration for processing payments
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login (with role-based access control)
- **API**: RESTful API for interaction with the frontend and external services
- **Other Libraries**: Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate for database management

---

## System Architecture

1. **User Authentication**: Using Flask-Login, users authenticate based on their role (admin, manager, waiter, inventory manager).
2. **Inventory Management**: The inventory is managed through a CRUD system where the inventory manager can add, update, and delete stock items.
3. **Order Management**: Orders are tracked in a centralized database, and status updates occur in real-time, automatically affecting the inventory.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can access a summary of club operations, including user activity, inventory levels, and order statuses.

---

## Roles and Access

### Inventory Manager

---

## Order Management Workflow

1. **Order Placement**: Waiters log an order in the system, adding items and order status.
2. **Order Status Update**: As orders are processed (e.g., unpaid -> pending -> served -> paid), the status is updated by waiters.
3. **Inventory Update**: When an order is paid, the inventory automatically updates, reducing the quantity of the ordered items.
4. **Manager Review**: Managers can monitor all orders and track which waiter handled each.

---

## Inventory Management Workflow

1. **Add Inventory**: Inventory managers can add new items in bulk with categories, quantities, and prices.
2. **Update Inventory**: Inventory is automatically updated as items are consumed through orders.
3. **View Inventory**: Managers can see a summary of all inventory items, including total quantities and prices.

## REST API Endpoints

## Future Enhancements
